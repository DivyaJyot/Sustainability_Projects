Idea Submission Problem Statement
The linear "take-make-dispose" model of production and consumption has led to significant environmental degradation and resource depletion, with waste generation being one of the major contributors to these issues. Therefore, there is a need for digital solutions that can promote circular economy practices and reduce waste generation by enabling the reuse, repair, and recycling of resources.

Solution Expected:

The challenge for this hackathon is to develop a digital solution that can promote circular economy practices and reduce waste generation. The solutions must address climate or environmental, OR waters OR waste OR bio-diversity OR social OR governance parameters OR a combination of the above across specific industries.

Here are a few sample scenarios on different sectors that could be used for the hackathon:

Retail

Accurately measuring and reducing carbon emissions beginning with processing and manufacturing, on through gaining visibility through the supply chain and point-of-sale
Addressing waste across all processes and implementing remediating processes, like recycling, re-commerce, and reuse
Implementing solutions that allow for better tracking and tracing of materials and goods across the supply chain, where the majority of the waste in the retail and consumer goods industries is produced
Shifting consumer behaviors through transparent sourcing of materials that are environmentally friendly products and goods in order to create greater consumer buy-in
